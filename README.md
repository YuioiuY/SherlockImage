This project was made with the aim of processing real images from fake ones. For example, a test dataset was compiled from fake images of dogs and a real one made up of photos taken from kaggle.

## P.S.

I have specifically divided everything into classes, for ease of further work on this project. At this stage, it will be possible to check only dogs, but in the future, you can also create datasets for people, cars, buildings, etc.
